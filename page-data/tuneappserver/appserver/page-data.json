However, it is recommended\nto use three or more application servers per cluster to ensure good performance and quality of service in case of server failure.\n\nAnother consideration for the number of application servers is the number of cores that are available from the operating\nsystem. In general, it is recommended to keep the number of threads in a Social Program Management application server\nto a low multiplier of the number of cores, as described in the [Thread pools](/tuneappserver/thread-pools) section. However,\na high number of cores can result in a very high number of threads and, therefore, a higher probability of threads\ncontending on Java locks. In that case, it is advisable to split the threads across multiple application servers\ninstead of just one, which reduces the probability of contention. However, a drawback of this approach is increased\nmemory utilization on the operating system as multiple JVMs are needed.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"83dd8025cc4f14d7f1da6da5a86a40eb","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":111},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tuning the application server","description":"Tuning the application server","tabs":["AppServer","JVM Settings","Thread Pools","JDBC Settings","JMS Settings","WAS Java 2 Security"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Tuning the application server\ndescription: Tuning the application server\ntabs: ['AppServer','JVM Settings', 'Thread Pools', 'JDBC Settings', 'JMS Settings', 'WAS Java 2 Security']\n---\n\nUse these starting values for application server tuning parameters to tune your application servers.\nThe parameters are key to the performance of Social Program Management on applications servers such as WebSphere®\nApplication Server (WAS) and WebLogic Server (WLS).
