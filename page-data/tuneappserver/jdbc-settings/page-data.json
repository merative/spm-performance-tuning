Size the`jdbc/curamdb` data source connection pool to prevent deadlocks,\nwith more connections available than threads that SPM uses. Therefore, size the connection pool for the\n`jdbc/curamdb` data source by using the following formula:\n\n<br/>\n<strong>WebSphere</strong>\n\n```\nmax_connections = WebContainer_max_threads + SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads + 1\n```\n\n<br/>\n<strong>WebLogic</strong>\n\n```\nmax_connections = default_max_thread_constraint + MDBWorkManager_max_thread_constraint + 1\n```\n\nIf a firewall exists between the application servers and the database, to prevent issues that are\nrelated to `StaleConnectionException`, we recommend setting `min_connections = 0` and `reapTime<= unused connection timeout <= firewall timeout`.\n\nAs a starting value for SPM, set the data source prepared statement cache size for `jdbc/curamdb` to `1000`.\nThen, monitor the cache use and increase it if discards occur. In our experience, preventing discards can increase throughput by up to 20%.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** While we recommend an initial value of 1000 for the prepared statement cache to prevent discards,\nthis value can be too high for SPM-based systems that have many threads and that are memory constrained.\nIn that case, it is recommended to review the SQLStats from the JMX Stats, from either load tests or production.\nThen, use a simple heuristic based on the distribution of SQL executions to find a smaller cache size that covers around\n90% of SQL executions from the application and gives a better balance between system performance and Java™ heap utilization.\nHowever, monitor prepared statement cache discards, system performance, and heap utilization, and adjust the cache size further as needed.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Data source: jdbc/curamsibdb\n\nAs all SPM transactions can potentially create a JMS message, size the connection pool for the `jdbc/curamsibdb` data source by using the following formula:\n\n<br/>\n<strong>WebSphere</strong>\n\n```\nmax_connections = WebContainer_max_threads + SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads + 1\n```\n\n<br/>\n<strong>WebLogic</strong>\n\n```\nmax_connections = default_max_thread_constraint + MDBWorkManager_max_thread_constraint + 1\n```\n\nTo prevent the processing cost of pool growth and shrinkage, it is suggested to set`min_connections = max_connections`.\n\nIf a firewall exists between the application servers and the database, to prevent issues that are related to `StaleConnectionException`,\nwe recommend setting `min_connections = 0` and `reapTime<= unused connection timeout <= firewall timeout`.\n\n## Data source: jdbc/curamtimerdb\n\nThe EJB timer service is used by all SPM transactions, but only once per transaction, in our application infrastructure\nand at the very start of an SPM transaction.
