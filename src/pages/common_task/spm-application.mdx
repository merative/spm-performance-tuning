Use the following guidelines for basic tuning of the Social Program Management application.

## Tuning the key server

For higher performance, consider setting `humanReadable=1` for all entries in the KeyServer.dmx files prior to building the database.

**Note:** If you set `humanReadable=1`, key allocation becomes sequential and therefore predictable. You must consider the use of this parameter in conjunction with your security requirements.

**Note:** Some customers have reported that when they use `humanReadable=1` and Oracle RAC, concurrent inserts into
the same table can cause heavy contention on index blocks. A solution to this problem is to re-create the primary
key index of the affected tables to be `REVERSE KEY`. However, using a `REVERSE KEY` index means that Oracle cannot
perform an index range scan on that index. This should not be a problem for primary key indexes as we mostly use
surrogate keys, which have no business meaning.

## Tuning ID generation

If the default ID generation algorithms are used, change them to use the key server to prevent contention.
Using the default ID generation algorithms could cause database contention. To use key server keysets set the value of the following application properties to `YES`:

| Property name  | Property  |
| :------------- | :-------- |
| Generate Provider Reference Number from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateproviderreferencenumberfromkeyset` |
| Generate Provider Group Reference Number from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateprovidergroupreferencenumberfromkeyset` |
| Generate External Party ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateexternalpartyidfromkeyset` |
| Generate Employer ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateemployeridfromkeyset` |
| Generate Person ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generatepersonidfromkeyset` |
| Generate Provider ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateinformationproviderridfromkeyset` |
| Generate Utility ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateutilityidfromkeyset` |
| Generate Service Supplier ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateservicesupplieridfromkeyset` |
| Generate Product Provider ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generateproductprovideridfromkeyset` |
| Generate Representative ID from Key Set | `curam.referencenumber.generaterepresentativeidfromkeyset` |

## Tuning the cache

To improve performance, resize the following caches to the values as indicated in the table below. Monitor the caches and increase their size if evictions occur.

| Cache  | Recommended value |
| :----- | :----------------- |
|`curam.cache.curam-group.componentModelCache.size`|100000|
|`curam.cache.curam-group.CREOLERuleSetDtlsCache.size`|Higher than the number of rule sets that are stored in the `CREOLERuleSet` table|
|`curam.cache.curam-group.RuleSetSnapshotIDCache.size`|Set the size to the largest of the following two values:  <ol><li> Three times the number of rule sets that are stored in the CREOLERuleSet table.</li> <li>The number of snapshots that are stored in the `CREOLERuleSetSnapshot` table.</li></ol>|

## Tuning login

The first login on a cold application server is usually slower than subsequent logins, and can exceed
the application server transaction timeout. To avoid slow first logins, you can set a custom value for
the `LoginBeanTransaction.transaction.timeout` property.

Set the value of the `LoginBeanTransaction.transaction.timeout` property to greater than the application server
transaction timeout. When the value is set, the value overrides the application server transaction timeout for the login transaction.
