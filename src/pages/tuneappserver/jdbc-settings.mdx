Set the JDBC connection pools for the Social Program Management data sources.

## Data source: jdbc/curamdb

A Social Program Management (SPM) transaction can require two JDBC connections, one for the transaction
itself and another one for the key server. Size the`jdbc/curamdb` data source connection pool to prevent deadlocks,
with more connections available than threads that SPM uses. Therefore, size the connection pool for the
`jdbc/curamdb` data source by using the following formula:

<br/>
<strong>WebSphere</strong>

```
max_connections = WebContainer_max_threads + SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads + 1
```

<br/>
<strong>WebLogic</strong>

```
max_connections = default_max_thread_constraint + MDBWorkManager_max_thread_constraint + 1
```

If a firewall exists between the application servers and the database, to prevent issues that are
related to `StaleConnectionException`, we recommend setting `min_connections = 0` and `reapTime<= unused connection timeout <= firewall timeout`.

As a starting value for SPM, set the data source prepared statement cache size for `jdbc/curamdb` to `1000`.
Then, monitor the cache use and increase it if discards occur. In our experience, preventing discards can increase throughput by up to 20%.

**Note:** While we recommend an initial value of 1000 for the prepared statement cache to prevent discards,
this value can be too high for SPM-based systems that have many threads and that are memory constrained.
In that case, it is recommended to review the SQLStats from the JMX Stats, from either load tests or production.
Then, use a simple heuristic based on the distribution of SQL executions to find a smaller cache size that covers around
90% of SQL executions from the application and gives a better balance between system performance and Java™ heap utilization.
However, monitor prepared statement cache discards, system performance, and heap utilization, and adjust the cache size further as needed.

## Data source: jdbc/curamsibdb

As all SPM transactions can potentially create a JMS message, size the connection pool for the `jdbc/curamsibdb` data source by using the following formula:

<br/>
<strong>WebSphere</strong>

```
max_connections = WebContainer_max_threads + SIBJMSRAThreadPool_max_threads + 1
```

<br/>
<strong>WebLogic</strong>

```
max_connections = default_max_thread_constraint + MDBWorkManager_max_thread_constraint + 1
```

To prevent the processing cost of pool growth and shrinkage, it is suggested to set`min_connections = max_connections`.

If a firewall exists between the application servers and the database, to prevent issues that are related to `StaleConnectionException`,
we recommend setting `min_connections = 0` and `reapTime<= unused connection timeout <= firewall timeout`.

## Data source: jdbc/curamtimerdb

The EJB timer service is used by all SPM transactions, but only once per transaction, in our application infrastructure
and at the very start of an SPM transaction. Currently, no reference to or usage of this service exists after the very start of an SPM transaction.

You can tune the size of the `jdbc/curamtimerdb` data source connection pool to be the same size as the number of threads,
which would ensure that no contention can occur on the pool. However, given that the time that is spent using the
EJB timer service is typically short compared to the duration of the transactions, a smaller size should work well
without significant contention. So our advice is to start with the default size, monitor the system, and then increase
the size if evidence exists of a significant contention under normal conditions.

We have not had to resize the `jdbc/curamtimerdb` data source connection pool in our load tests of SPM in a default installation,
where our application servers are tuned for high throughput and memory protection. In such an environment,
the number of threads is a low multiplier of the number of cores that are available to the application server,
as documented in the [Thread pools](/tuneappserver/thread-pools) section.
