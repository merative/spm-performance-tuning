Use the Apache module `mod_deflate` to compress the content that is served by the HTTP Server.

## Static content

To apply the configuration for SPM static content, configure the following settings in the `httpd.conf` file on the HTTP server.
This example assumes that you are using the relative URL `/CuramStatic/`.

```shell
<LocationMatch /(Curam|CuramStatic)>
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css application/x-
javascript
# Netscape 4.x has some problems...
BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html
# Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems
BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip
# MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine
BrowserMatch \bMSI[E] !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html
# Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content
Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary
...
<LocationMatch/>

```

## Web applications

To apply the configuration for web applications, such as the Universal Access Responsive Web Application,
configure the following settings in the `httpd.conf` file on the HTTP server.
This example assumes that you are using the relative URL `/universal` for your Universal Access Responsive
Web Application application, and that the SPM REST APIs are being served from `/Rest`.

```shell
# List of MIME types that can be compressed provided with the out-of-the-box application
# some of them might be already configured in your HTTP server, please edit as required
<IfModule mime_module>
  AddType image/x-icon .ico
  AddType application/javascript .js
  AddType application/json json
  AddType image/svg+xml svg
  AddType text/css css
  AddType text/html html
</IfModule>

# mod_filter is needed for "AddOutputFilterByType" in IHS9 (Apache 2.4)
<IfModule !mod_filter.c>
  LoadModule filter_module modules/mod_filter.so
</IfModule>
<IfModule !mod_deflate.c>
  LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so
</IfModule>

# Assuming /Rest is mapped to the Curam SPM REST API application,
# you can add it to LocationMatch to benefit from the compression of file types like JSON or SVG
<LocationMatch /(universal|Rest)>
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/css application/x-javascript application/javascript image/svg+xml application/json image/x-icon image/vnd.microsoft.icon
  # Netscape 4.x has some problems...
  BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html
  # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems
  BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip
  # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine
  BrowserMatch \bMSI[E] !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html
  # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content
  Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary
</LocationMatch>
```
